<h2 align="center"> Project 1:üê∂ Pretrained Pet Image Classifier </h2>
<h5 align="left"> This project classifies pet images using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It determines whether the images contain dogs and identifies their breeds using three different CNN models: VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet. The script compares the model predictions to the actual labels derived from filenames and generates a summary of performance statistics. </h5>

<h2 align="center"> Project 2: Pet Image Classifier from scratch </h2>
<h5 align="left"> This project hosts a trained deep learning model for classifying different species of Pets, using a custom-built classifier on top of a Resnet50-based neural network. The model achieves 96% validation accuracy. This project was originally developed as the final project for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree by Udacity. The trained model is hosted for inference, allowing users to classify flower species using an image. </h5>
